        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>My name is Drew Brandle. I am a Tecumseh High School student. I am also attend SICTC for Computer Science. I am a kind, empethic, hard working, and loving person and have been
            told this by many of my peers. I hope to get into the field of Computer Sciece, Computer Engineering, or Animation and VFX. I have always been intresed in technology since I
            was young. My mom works in IT so I learned a thing or two through my years. Now that Technology and Ai are advancing everyday I have found that getting into a career in 
            Technology will be benifical for me.
